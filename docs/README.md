## 💡 Tips for Writing Good Documentation

1. **Start with Why** - Explain the purpose before the details
2. **Use Examples** - Show, don't just tell
3. **Keep it Current** - Update docs when you change code
4. **Be Concise** - Respect the reader's time
5. **Link Heavily** - Connect related information
6. **Use Diagrams** - A picture is worth 1000 words
